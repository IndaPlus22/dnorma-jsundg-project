# Project Specification
[Project](https://github.com/IndaPlus22/dnorma-jsundg-project)

## Platformer with Go
We aim to make a platformer with Golang. We'll make use of the [Pixel package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/faiface/pixel). The game will be in singleplayer and the playable character will be able to interact with objects and obstacles in different ways. The project is quite feasible since we use a package for the graphics which is the main concern. A full completion of the project might not be as feasible since the team isn't very experienced with game development.

We will be using a simpler version of Git Flow as our Git methodology. There will be a `main`branch which is protected from pushes - only merging pull requests can be done. Under `main` is the `develop` branch which merges all `feature` branches. This branch only merges with main once a major milestones has been reached. There will also be `feature` branches which handle one issue at the time. They all merge in to the `develop` branch when completed.

### The game
The game will have 2D graphics and the camera will move with the character. The character will be a goose(?)(for now) that gets powerups from potions(drinks). The win condition is to defeat all enemies and get to the exit. The player will be able get achievements in the form of m√§rken.
 
### Requirements
* There should be a playable character that can move around the map with the WASD keys
    * Player collisions has to be implemented
    * Getting rid of obstacles should be available in certain situations
* There should be obstacles that the player can interact with
    * "Enemies" with simple movement paths should exist
* The player should be able to win or lose
    * Scores and highscores should be kept
* Decent graphics on everything

## Naming conventions
##### Issues and commits
Issues and commit messages are going to be named according to github standards, in other words in future tense. Examples: "Add wall collision", "Fix annoying bug".

##### Pull requests
Pull requests will be named after their associated issue. It will be in the format of "issue/[issue number]-[issue-name], i.e issue #13 "Improve performance" would be "issue/13-improve-performance".
